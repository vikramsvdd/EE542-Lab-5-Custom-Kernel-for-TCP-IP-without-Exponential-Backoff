# EE542-Lab-5-Custom-Kernel-for-TCP-IP-without-Exponential-Backoff

Hello Guys,! Welcome to my GitHub page. Here I along with my teammates have worked on removing the exponential backoff for TCP/IP and then built a custom kernel patching it to onto an AWS instance. 

We used AWS t3xLarge instances for ubuntu 22 based client and server, and c5nlarge for vyos based router. 

As the image file is large, PFA the [drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TSwMnZnliRKstiyG-CB0ZTMuCx5u08SP?usp=drive_link) to the file

We have attached our TCP codes as well as our kernel images above. Please refer to our [youtube video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=todOqsPI3iM&list=PLwbusIR2TXc9L8mw6yynKaSLTFpsQmKYD&index=1) for an in-detail tutorial.
